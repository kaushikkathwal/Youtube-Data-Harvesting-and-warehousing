# Youtube-Data-Harvesting-and-warehousing
This is a data science project in which the data is extracted ,stored and processed

Youtube Data Harvesting and warehousing using Youtube API, Python , MongoDB And Streamlit.

Domain Name : Social Media

Introduction
This Project involves retrieving of data from the Youtube API ,storing in MongoDB and then migrating it to SQL Data Warehouse and then displaying the Data in Streamlit web app. And all this is done with the help back end programming in Python.

Procedure
Step1: Data Extraction

Firstly with the help of API key which i got from Google API client library , is used to make requests to the Youtube API ,with the help of python program the data related to the channel is extracted from the youtube servers.

Step2: Collection To Mongo DB

In second Step the data which is extracted , is now getting stored in MongoDB Data lake , which is a NoSQL Database great choice for handling unstructured and semistructured Data .

Step3: Data Migration To SQL

Now the data is transferred to SQL Database ,it is done to convert non structured data into structured format.

Step4: Accessing Different information related to channels

With the help of structured data , now the information regarding channels is easily accessible .
it can be done with the help of different queries in SQl.

Step5: Data visualization

To visualize the data , Streamlit Web application is used in which all the data is scrapped ,stored and migrated .
This streamlit web application act as a front end user interface for the user to do all the processes in easy manner.

Technologies Used:

Youtube API, Python, MongoDB, SQL, Streamlit

conclusion:

This project aims to develop a user-friendly Streamlit application that utilizes the Google API to extract information on a YouTube channel, stores it in a MongoDB database, migrates it to a SQL data warehouse, and enables users to search for channel details and join tables to view data in the Streamlit app.
